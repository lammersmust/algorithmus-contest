        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
        <p>Algorithmus is an international contest in algorithm programming, in which IT experts solve complex algorithmic challenges using Java, C++ and Go. This contest provides a wide range of real-world problems in the form of interesting challenges. You can find your own way in implementing solutions. It allows to demonstrate your creative and technical skills and get valuable awards.</p>
        <p><b>Participant Requirements</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Algorithmus contest is for experienced and practicing IT experts.</li>
            <li>No entry fee is required.</li>
            <li>All participants must register to take part in the Algorithmus contest.</li>
            <li>Registration on the contest is available from 11:00 AM to 11 PM on 13rd of June, 2019 (Moscow time zone UTC + 3).</li>
            <li>The contest organizer can make a decision to disqualify any сontestant for submitting invalid information during the registration process.</li>
            <li>Solutions must be created solely by the contestant.</li>
            <li>Teamwork is not allowed and can lead to disqualification.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Contest Process</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>All сontestants are able to submit and validate their solutions automatically using validation system during the contest.</li>
            <li>The сontestants should submit in the web interface his or her solutions only if the solutions are ready. They won’t be able to submit and validate the same solutions again.</li>
            <li>The сontestants must select their programming language before submitting their solutions in the web interface. Pay attention that default programming language is Java.</li>
            <li>After submitting the solutions by сontestants, the validation system runs them against a bunch of test cases that are the same for all contestants.</li>
            <li>The solutions are considered as accepted if they produce correct answers to all test cases in the given time and memory limits.</li>
            <li>Validation is run automatically, so the solutions have to satisfy input and output formats described in the task descriptions.</li>
            <li>All input data has to be proper and satisfy all constraints mentioned in the task description.</li>
            <li>The сontestants can spend as much time as they want on solving the tasks but their solutions must be submitted by 10:00 PM on 20th of June, 2019 (Moscow time zone, UTC + 3). Otherwise their solutions wouldn't be validated.</li>
            <li>The сontestants are considered by quality of solved tasks.</li>
            <li>The ones who solve all the tasks with the same quality are considered individually the judges.</li>
            <li>The judges check code quality, their logic of algorithms and singularity of their approaches. Then the judges vote for a сontestant who is the best from their point of view.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All сontestants are considered as substantial contributors and get electronic diplomas that indicate their results.</p>
